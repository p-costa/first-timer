Simple timing routines to be used in codes which use MPI and possibly CUDA/OpenACC.

### Credits
[wcdawn/ftime](https://github.com/wcdawn/ftime) was used as the starting point, together with the NVTX Fortran bindings from [maxcuda/NVTX_Example](https://github.com/maxcuda/NVTX_example) adapted here.
